# SVM-weatherClassification-MWD

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning solution for classifying weather conditions in images using the MWD dataset. The approach uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction and classification.

## Dataset
The MWD dataset consists of 1125 images categorized into distinct weather classes. Some images were excluded due to loading issues.

## Methodology
Features extracted include color space data histograms and Difference of Gaussian (DoG) features. The project iteratively improved feature selection for SVM performance, emphasizing feature quality.

## Implementation
Implemented in Python within a Jupyter Notebook, using libraries such as Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, seaborn, OpenCV, and Numpy.

## Results
The SVM model achieved high accuracy in classifying various weather conditions, with detailed results and analysis available in the accompanying report.

## Future Work
Potential improvements include semantic segmentation for more complex analyses.

## Usage
Instructions for setup and usage are outlined in the Jupyter Notebook, with detailed explanations in the report.
